<h1>Search and Stay Test</h1>

This is a scanner app that can lookup for details of network hardwares (such as network cards) by their MAC addresses.

The motivation to build this application is to showcase Flutter working with native APIs through MethodChannels (to get acquainted of more details, visit <a href=https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels>Writing custom platform-specific code</a>).

This app was mainly designed in **Flutter/iOS** that means any API is being consumed natively.

Since the app was developed using native iOS APIs, the app **will only work on iOS devices** (It will build and run normally, but an exception will be thrown when running on a non-iOS device).

<h1>Getting started</h1>

- This is an Apple-based software developed under the Apple SDK (iOS, MacOS, TvOS, etc), check if you are using a MacOS system to build and run the app properly.

- Look if you have an Integrated Development Environment with Flutter enabled (IDE; Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, etc) installed properly on your machine.

- Open a terminal and run <code>git -v</code> to look for Git is set up.

- On the same terminal, run <code>flutter doctor</code> to see whether Flutter is installed and configured accordingly in your system. If not, you can follow the step-by-step documentation <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started">here</a>.

- Clone the repository through CLI (<code>git clone https://github.com/Dev4LifeV/Mac_Scanner</code>) or through <a href="x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/Dev4LifeV/Mac_Scanner">GitHub Desktop</a> and place in your favorite directory.

- Open your IDE and locate for the project folder.

- Then start the the project by building and running through your IDE.
